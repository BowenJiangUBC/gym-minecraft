- document dependencies and running in README.md
- run preliminary models
- add task descriptions for other missions
- package Minecraft as minecraft_py

- start Minecraft process automatically (and shut down in close())
  * if Minecraft is started from __init__ every time, then it's gonna be slow
  * we could check if Minecraft is already running and if not, run it ourselves
  * but that would require path to Minecraft folder. maybe it's easier for user to just run Minecraft manually?
  * there is no point in shutting down Minecraft in close(), that would make subsequent runs very slow
- produce observation spaces automatically based on requested (or default) features
  * not used currently?
- allow configuration of MissionRecordSpec
  * kinda useless?
- add support for AbsoluteCommands
